Using EDA to prevent loan rejections for capable applicants while minimizing financial losses. Analyzing applicant and loan attributes for default insights.
There are two primary risks in loan processing: rejecting applicants who can repay (resulting in lost business) and approving applicants who can't repay (leading to financial losses). To address these risks, we analyze a dataset containing loan application information that falls into two categories:

Customers with payment difficulties: These are applicants who experienced late payments of more than X days on at least one of the first Y installments of the loan.

All other cases: These are applicants whose payments were made on time.

When an applicant applies for a loan, there are four possible outcomes:

Approved: The company approves the loan application.
Cancelled: The applicant cancels the application during the approval process.
Refused: The company rejects the loan.
Unused Offer: The loan is approved, but the customer does not use it.

Data Analytics Tasks:
A. Identify Missing Data and Deal with it Appropriately: As a data analyst, you come across missing data in the loan application dataset. It is essential to handle missing data effectively to ensure the accuracy of the analysis.
Task: Identify the missing data in the dataset and decide on an appropriate method to deal with it using Excel built-in functions and features.

B. Identify Outliers in the Dataset: Outliers can significantly impact the analysis and distort the results. You need to identify outliers in the loan application dataset.
Task: Detect and identify outliers in the dataset using Excel statistical functions and features, focusing on numerical variables.

C. Analyze Data Imbalance: Data imbalance can affect the accuracy of the analysis, especially for binary classification problems. Understanding the data distribution is crucial for building reliable models.
Task: Determine if there is data imbalance in the loan application dataset and calculate the ratio of data imbalance using Excel functions.

D. Perform Univariate, Segmented Univariate, and Bivariate Analysis: To gain insights into the driving factors of loan default, it is important to conduct various analyses on consumer and loan attributes.
Task: Perform univariate analysis to understand the distribution of individual variables, segmented univariate analysis to compare variable distributions for different scenarios, and bivariate analysis to explore relationships between variables and the target variable using Excel functions and features.

E. Identify Top Correlations for Different Scenarios: Understanding the correlation between variables and the target variable can provide insights into strong indicators of loan default.
Task: Segment the dataset based on different scenarios (e.g., clients with payment difficulties and all other cases) and identify the top correlations for each segmented data using Excel functions.
