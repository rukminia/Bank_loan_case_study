Using EDA to prevent loan rejections for capable applicants while minimizing financial losses. Analyzing applicant and loan attributes for default insights.
There are two primary risks in loan processing: rejecting applicants who can repay (resulting in lost business) and approving applicants who can't repay (leading to financial losses). To address these risks, we analyze a dataset containing loan application information that falls into two categories:

Customers with payment difficulties: These are applicants who experienced late payments of more than X days on at least one of the first Y installments of the loan.

All other cases: These are applicants whose payments were made on time.

When an applicant applies for a loan, there are four possible outcomes:

Approved: The company approves the loan application.
Cancelled: The applicant cancels the application during the approval process.
Refused: The company rejects the loan.
Unused Offer: The loan is approved, but the customer does not use it.
